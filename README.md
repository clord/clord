# Hi there, I'm Christopher Lord 👋

*I build things, and try my best to make those things as great as I can.*

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Staff Software Engineer at [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com)**, where I work AI features and functionality, with a focus on user interface and user experience. 

Based on the family ranch in Alberta, Canada 🍁🐴, I hack in Haskell, Typescript, Rust, and C++, trying to eat right and live in balance. When I'm not coding, you might find me watching the northern lights with my kids taking care of the chickens.

## 🔭 Currently Working On

- Building and scaling AI interfaces at **Grafana Labs** (4+ years and counting!)
- Running **[Pliosoft Corporation](http://www.pliosoft.com)** - my consulting company since 2014
- Maintaining open-source projects

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Languages

### Languages I Hack In
- **Haskell** λ - For when elegance matters
- **Rust** 🦀 - Because proper generics and result enums are non-negotiable
- **TypeScript** 📘 - Types are great, and javascript is everywhere
- **C++** - 7+ years at IBM building compilers taught me a thing or two
- **Ruby** 💎 - Still holds a special place in my toolkit
- **Go** - Though I might rage-quit over lack of proper generics...

### Areas of Deep Expertise
- **Compiler Development** - Former IBM compiler architect, worked on C++ and Fortran compilers
- **Observability & Monitoring** - Making complex systems understandable at Grafana
- **Systems Programming** - From OS kernels to supercomputer apps
- **Full-Stack Development** - Websites, mobile apps, and everything in between

## 🎓 Background

- **University of Alberta** - BSc in Computer Science (2002-2006)
  - Built a Pascal compiler, MIPS pipeline simulator, and Unix OS kernel
  - Almost double-majored in Mathematics
- **IBM Canada** - Compiler Developer (2006-2014)
  - C++ compiler development and company-wide compiler IL architect
  - Delivered full F2003 language standard support for Fortran compiler

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- React Server Components (bye bye REST/GraphQL APIs! JSX on the wire)
- Advanced AI user interface patterns
- Functional programming patterns in production systems

## 💬 Ask Me About

- Building compilers and understanding language internals
- The joy of functional programming in real-world applications
- Why arrow functions shouldn't be used everywhere in JavaScript
- Life on a ranch while working in tech

## 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On

- Functional programming libraries that actually ship to production
- Developer tools that reduce complexity without adding abstraction layers
- Open-source observability and monitoring solutions

## 🎯 Philosophy

*"The initial step should be to reduce complexity, cut processes, and narrow the scope. Aim to deliver smaller features more frequently: maintain momentum. Teams should pursue their passions within the project direction - rigidity diminishes motivation and creativity."*
